## Add RALGO AI to your server

To add RALGO AI to your server, follow these steps:

### 1. Click on the [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=929247872849960970&permissions=2147871856&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to open the authorization page in your web browser. 

### 2. Select the server you want to add the bot to from the drop-down menu. If you are not the owner of the server, you will need to have the "Manage Server" permission to do this.

The bot should now be added to your server and you should see a message indicating that the bot has joined. You can then use the bot by the slash commands.
